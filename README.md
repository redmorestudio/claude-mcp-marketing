        "BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY": "YOUR_BRAVE_API_KEY_HERE"

      "env": {
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY_HERE"
      }
    },
    "slack": {
      "env": {
        "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "xoxb-YOUR_SLACK_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    },
    "bluesky": {
      "env": {
        "BLUESKY_USERNAME": "YOUR_BLUESKY_USERNAME",
        "BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD": "YOUR_BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation:

1. **Node.js not found**: Make sure Node.js is properly installed and in your PATH
2. **Python not found**: Ensure Python is installed and in your PATH
